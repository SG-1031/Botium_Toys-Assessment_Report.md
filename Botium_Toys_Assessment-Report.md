# Botium Toys: Scope, Goals, and Risk Assessment Report
## Scope and Goals of the Audit
**Scope:**  
The scope is defined as the entire security program at Botium Toys. This includes assessment of all assets alongside internal processes and procedures related to the implementation of controls and compliance best practices.

**Goals:**  
Assess existing assets and complete the controls and compliance checklist to determine which controls and compliance best practices need to be implemented to improve Botium Toys’ security posture.

## Current Assets
Assets managed by the IT Department include:
- On-premises equipment for in-office business needs  
- Employee equipment: end-user devices (desktops/laptops, smartphones), remote workstations, headsets, cables, keyboards, mice, docking stations, surveillance cameras, etc.  
- Storefront products available for retail sale on site and online; stored in the company’s adjoining warehouse  
- Management of systems, software, and services: accounting, telecommunication, database, security, ecommerce, and inventory management  
- Internet access  
- Internal network  
- Data retention and storage  
- Legacy system maintenance: end-of-life systems that require human monitoring  

## Risk Assessment
### Risk Description
There is inadequate management of assets. Additionally, Botium Toys does not have all of the proper controls in place and may not be fully compliant with U.S. and international regulations and standards.

### Control Best Practices
The first of the five functions of the NIST CSF is Identify. Botium Toys will need to:
- Dedicate resources to identifying and appropriately managing assets  
- Classify existing assets  
- Determine the impact of the loss of existing assets, including systems, on business continuity  

### Risk Score
**Score:** 8/10  
This high score reflects the lack of controls and poor adherence to compliance best practices.
